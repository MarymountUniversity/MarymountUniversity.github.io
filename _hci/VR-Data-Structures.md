excerpt: "This research explores the use of virtual reality (VR) in Computer Science education to enhance the visualization and understanding of algorithm complexity and data structures. The proposed VR system aims to provide undergraduate students with a more tangible and interactive learning experience, allowing them to interact with algorithms and data structures in a virtual environment. Through the implementation of immersive techniques and real-time visualization, students can manipulate and observe the behavior of these abstract concepts. The VR application covers topics such as algorithm analysis, queues, stacks, tree structures, and algorithmic complexity. The use of VR in Computer Science education has the potential to transform teaching methods and provide instructors with valuable supplementary materials. Future studies will evaluate the impact of VR on student learning outcomes, and the VR application will be made available for further research and instruction in the field."

The metaverse offers different promises depending on who
is speaking about it . All sides seem to agree that the
Metaverse requires some aspect of the Virtual but its final
applications are up in the air. Some define it as a new medium
for the exchange of digital goods, and others see it used as a
job training and a new digital town square.
Virtual Reality (VR) has been applied to many domains
such as entertainment, education, and healthcare. Its use in
education has primarily been in simulating real life scenarios
in a safe virtual world. The use of VR to make Computer
Science theory more concrete and tangible by enhancing the
visualization and understanding of complex algorithms and
data structures has not been fully explored. This research
presents a novel system for using VR to transform algorithm
analysis and data structures into a more tangible and visual
experience. This research aims to help undergraduate Com-
puter Science students gain a deeper understanding of these
abstract concepts by visualizing them in an interactive way.
We implemented and deployed a VR experience that allows
users to interact with algorithms and data structures in a
virtual environment. This includes the use of commercial-
grade VR headsets and through prerecorded lectures in the VR
space. In the pilot program, the application contains worlds
that include learning about algorithm analysis, queues, stacks,
tree structures, and tree rotations. The user can select a data
structure and interact with its behavior in real-time.
The VR application utilizes several immersive techniques
to enhance the user experience. The user can grab blocks of
data, edit the contents, and use them in their selected data
structure. Depending on their contents and interaction, they
can observe the relationships between the data blocks and
other elements. Each data structure includes basic insertion,
deletion, and search functionality. Students can observe and
draw algorithmic complexity conclusions visually in real time.
An additional world for algorithm complexity is included,
where students can select a Big O complexity and select
various values for N. Up to 3 complexities can be selected
at the same time. Once selected, all 3 will run by generating
3D objects according to the complexity. This enables students
to have a concrete sense between the differences and scale of
Big O complexities.
The ability to interact with these abstract concepts in a more
tangible way can help learners gain a deeper understanding of
the fundamental principles of Computer Science and improve
their problem solving skills. VR has the potential to augment
the way Computer Science is taught and experienced by
students. Immersive education has the ability to help retain
the focus of students in the class and also provide instructors
with additional material for students that cannot be replicated
through typical forms of online cheating.
Currently both the VR application and VR recorded videos
are being used as supplemental materials in the course as
additional mediums of obtaining learning outcomes. Future
studies will test studentsâ€™ comprehension of these topics with
and without VR material. Additionally, the VR application will
be available to researchers and instructors.
II. RELATED WORK
Data Structures is a core course in most Computer Science
programs and as such instructors have tried a variety of ways
of teaching and engaging students from competitive game
projects to using 3D modeling to create and interact with
structures .
Much of the work in education and VR is related to social
presence . This research was of heightened importance
during the COVID-19 pandemic as in-person resources and
interactions became scarce.
