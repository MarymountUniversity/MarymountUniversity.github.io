title: "Defining the Metaverse through the lens of academic scholarship, news articles, and social media"

permalink: /hci/Metaverse-Defined
excerpt: "The emergence of the Metaverse has received varied attention from academic scholars, news media, and social media. While the term ’Metaverse’ has been around since Neil Stevenson’s 1992 novel, Snow Crash, the definition of the Metaverse changes depending on who and when it is described. In this study we analyze various works about the Metaverse from ACM publications on the topic, to news media reports, to discussions on social media. Using topic modeling techniques and natural language analysis, we show how each community speaks about and defines the Metaverse."

Neologisms are recently-coined words most often associated with
the development of new methodologies and technology . The domain of neologisms includes Scientific Discoveries
and Inventions, Technological, Political, and Pop-culture. A recent
neologism is "Metaverse".
The first usage of Metaverse was in the Pop-culture domain via
Neil Stevenson’s 1992 novel, Snow Crash, where it was used to
describe a virtual retreat location for players bogged down by their
lives. Metaverse was later used to describe online universes available
via VR. In this paper, we explore the contextual differences in the us-
age of "Metaverse" across different domains. ACM publications were
used to investigate the Scientific Discoveries and Inventions Tech-
nological domain usage of Metaverse. While news media reports
and discussions on social media were used to explore the political
and pop-culture domain usage of Metaverse. Studying this will give
us a glimpse into the "intellect and thinking, scientific, historical
and cultural" developments generated by
the neologism "Metaverse".
This research aims to automatically extract topics from multi-
ple domains which discuss the Metaverse. We examine academic
papers, social media forums, and the news media on the subject.
Through the extraction of topics, keywords, and frequencies, we
aim to discover the commonalities in how different mediums define
the Metaverse. Additionally, we discuss how they differ in the focus
in their discussion.
